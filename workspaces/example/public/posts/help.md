#### Help

This project needs a little help.

It doesn't currently work with the vite dev server!

Maybe [this code](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/static.ts) is the most relevant part of vite to getting it working.

How can we generate an index.json file that the vite server will serve in the right location that matches up to how it is in build?

Head over to the [github repo](https://github.com/klm127/vite-plugin-indexify) and open a PR today!
